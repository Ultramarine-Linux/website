# We use this redirect to ensure that Plausible's download tracking works correctly
# Otherwise, we would have to send the user directly to the CDN which would cause Plausible to treat it as a outbound page visit instead of a download
# Also, Astro's redirects don't work for this, so we use Cloudflare pages redirects here
