              If you're looking for a new Linux distribution (or a new OS in general), I would highly recommend Ultramarine Linux Flagship.

            <div class="px-4 pb-4">
              <p>
                Ultramarine Linux was created out of frustration with the legal limits of Fedora. As Fedora (and Red Hat) is an American entity, there are legal restrictions on what software can be packaged in the distribution due to the US patent system.
                Ultramarine, on the other hand, is based in Thailand and is not subject to any of the copyright restrictions on what software can be packaged.
                The Ultramarine team aims to make Fedora a little more user-friendly by allowing users to install or package any software they want as long as someone maintains it in Flathub, RPMFusion, or Terra.
                In addition to this, we provide various UX improvements around the system, and in the future, custom apps.

            <div class="px-4 pb-4">
              <p>
                The migration scripts install RPMFusion, Terra repository, and our signing keys, then installs the bare minimum of an Ultramarine Linux installation on top of an existing Fedora installation (Swapping Fedora release packages with the Ultramarine ones). <br><br>

                The script only installs the bare minimum required for Ultramarine Linux to work because we donâ€™t want to add additional bloat to your current system.

              <p>
                As of now, the only data we collect is a count of how many times a package has been downloaded from Terra or the Ultramarine repository using <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/infra/sysadmin_guide/dnf-counting/" class="text-accent-300 hover:text-accent-400">DNF Counting</a>.

            <div class="px-4 pb-4">
              No. Ultramarine and Fedora are not semi-rolling or rolling. Instead, they use a stable release scheme. Updates with breaking changes are rolled out only for every stable release version. Minor updates / point updates are guaranteed to be backwards-compatible, i.e. system components in Ultramarine are updated if and only if they do not break compatibility.
